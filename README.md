# nvim.config

This is my configuration of [Nvim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) with [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) and the starter template provided by LazyVim which can be found [here](https://github.com/LazyVim/starter).

## Notes

- The configuration for Nvim must be placed into the folder `~/.config/nvim`.
- After cloning, the resulting folder has to be renamed from `nvim.config` to `nvim`.
